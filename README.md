    1. It's just a simple Python file. But first of all, make sure you have Python3 installed on your computer.
    2. Put the file somewhere in a new folder and run CMD -> python3 books.py (or just simply python, but be assured of not being the python2 version).
    3. Type in Noul (if you want to print a random book from the New Testament) or Vechiul (you've got the idea).

# Why this?
Because people need to read their Bible. The greatest need of a sinful man (regardless of nationality, reputation, status) is to obtain the forgiveness of sins, and that is just possible through the precious Blood of the Divine Lamb, the Person and His work on the Cross. I have created this by the Grace of the Lord. Though it's not complex, The Lord helped me, and I want others to be edified and benefit from it. May the Lord Christ bless you, dear ones!

    A small note: The code it's written in my native language, though if needed I can make changes. Basically the books of the Bible are in total 66 (Genesis - Apocalypse).
